I'm an interaction designer & researcher based in Toronto, passionate about building user experiences with a research driven, human-centred approach. Currently in my fourth year doing a capstone project working on toolkits to aid design students in developing effective ways to reflection on their work in a variety of ways.

I spend my school time outside classes taking part in leadership and mentoring positions within the student association for my program.
